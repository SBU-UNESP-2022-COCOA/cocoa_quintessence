# ACT-DR4 Likelihood
## Description
(From https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/pyactlike)
This is the Data Release 4 (DR4) CMB power spectrum likelihood measured by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), from the 2013â€“2016 survey covering >15,000 sq. deg. This spectrum has already been marginalized over SZ and foreground emission. The polarization efficiency (yp2) is the only nuisance parameter required to be sampled, and its fiducial value is 1. It is based on the WMAP and ACT team's likelihood software. Cite: Aiola et al. 2020, Choi et al. 2020.

This project is just an example on how to run chains using this foreground marginalized ACT likelihood. I use LambdaCDM with usual priors.
